Bandung city known for it's variety in cullinary. a lot of people came just to taste the food that can only be found in bandung, other than that there's so much place to hangout in bandung that it become destination itself for people that came to bandung and one of that place is cafe. here i'm trying to do a simple analysis about cafe in bandung, the data that i get was from [here](https://pergikuliner.com/restoran/bandung/)

## How many cafes in Bandung?
First thing first, let's see how much cafe are there in bandung and the comparison with other cullinary spot (restaurant, bakery, steakhouse, etc.)

As we can see from the chart above, we now know that almost half of cullinary type in bandung is cafe, passing the number of authentic restaurant, bakery, etc.

## Where to go?
Now we know that there's so much cafe spread in Bandung, to make the analysis simple i only take 10 area with the most cafe each.

Wow!! looks like riau area become the most cafe in bandung by overwhelming the number of cafe in other area, but are the best cafe placed in riau area?? let's try to analyze further.

## Which cafe is good?
Many of us often confused when we want to determine where the most suitable cafe we want to go, so from the data that i can get we can categorize it into it's flavor, ambience, worth(the comparison between flavor and price), service, and it's hygiene. here i try to visualize the best score in each category for each area.

to simplify, if i include only the top 5 to table

From the table we can know cafe that dominate the top 5 in each rating category is Communal Coffee, Mannery, Simini coffee, and Dapur Rahasia.
just from this simple analysis i can recommend you to go to this cafes :)

## How much we can spend?
Okay, maybe second thought we often think when we want to hangout is "how much the cost we spend to that cafe?", so here i try to generalize the average cost we can spend to the cafe based on each area and with 3 category spend range

From chart above now we know we shouldn't worry about the price because most of the area have spend range below 50k rupiah!!

## What kind of Cafe?
And here we often confused what type of cafe we want to go, sometime people just want to taste the food, drink or some just want a comfortable place to hangout, so based on each rating category i try to generalize the score and see the score for each category in each area

![image info](/assets/cafe/cafe_rating_each.png)

After we see chart aboce we now know which area best in each rating category, if we want to find cafe with good ambience we can go to **Dago Atas** area, and if we want to find cafe with good food&drink with good services we can go to **Dipatiukur** area.

## Add??
i try to find is there a cashless cafe in bandung soo here it is
